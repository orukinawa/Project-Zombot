EventMapper steps (if you want to make new level)
----------------------------
prefab name = EventMapper
! noted the row and col is reversed (sorry my bad)
- Define the row and col first needed in the level generator script
- then click create map button
- insert game object into the mBlockmap (note that all grid must be filled...no empty allow) 
- at least 1 3x3 dead End must be at the most right to connect to other block because it acts as a start point
- play.
