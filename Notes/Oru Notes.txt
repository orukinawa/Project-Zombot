//Stuff to fix

- Bullet Final //DONE
	- Give fake bullet a mesh
		- Like for angrybots
	- Only normal bullet use the single raycast technique //USES COLLIDER TOO
	- Other bullets use collider + ontriggerEnter raycast

- Bullet Collision
	- If the player is close (touching) an enemy, enemy doesn't get hit

- Bouncing Bullet // FIXED - when hit, raycast to wall to get wall distance then raycastall to get targets
	- If the next closest target is behind wall, the bullet will hit the wall and die
		- Raycast to each target to check if there is an obstacle in between?
		- Expensive?

- Make status listen directly to tickmanager
	- No need for status manager

- Camera movement
	- Find a way to center camera on player
		- Regardless of position and angle

- PoolManager
	- Make it a singleton
		- Check code for networking

- Make a gun mod combiner //NEED TO IMPROVE

- Find a way to show hit on enemy (decal)
	- Check Angry Bots
	- Decal with randomized size and rotation

- Find a better way to spawn a new weapon
	- Rework commando.cs into generic class


- Character Movement
	- Research about Rigidbody-child problem // CONFIRMED - CANT BE DONE
		- If child has a rigidbody, it doesn't follow the parent transform anymore
	- Consider making a one part character (no more base + body) // STICK WITH THIS FOR NOW
	- Try implementing rotation without rigidbody // WORKS
	- Cleanup Motor scripts // DONE
	- Add cursor // DONE

- Character Controller
	- Look is there is a way to use isTrigger like with Capsule/Box Collider // NOPE

- Bullets go through enemies at high speed
	- Possible solution:
		- Slow moving / sure hit bullets (homing, mortar) use collider
			- Use a long collider
		- Others (normal,piercing,bounce) use a single raycast to detect enemies
			- In that case, make a fake trail to simulate a bullet shot
			- Get the distance from the ray cast to determine the distance after which to kill the 'fake' shot

- When game is not fullscreen, do not detect cursor position outside of window
	- Might want to leave it in for close quarter combat
	- See how it works for melee weapons

- The mouse camera controls goes too far when cursor goes out of window
	- Disable camera control when mouse goes out of screen?
	- OR set mousePos to edge when cursor goes out of screen
	- Check how Alien Swarm does it
		- They don't allow cursor to get out of screen
	- Polish		
		- Vertical offset is bigger than horizontal offset to that the max distance you can aim vertical is the same as horizontal

- Make bullets ignore collision with player who fired it
	- See later for friendly fire

- Character Movement
	- Find a way to keep diagonal movement equal to vertical/horizontal while keeping Input acceleration

- Cleanup shotgun spread calculations

- Put a node on weapons to know where character should hold it

- Lookat class
	- Store/update exact cursor position
	- Or make the called function update the cursor position when needed only

- Fix camera and player hierachy
	- Who should keep track of the other and move the camera

- Componentize Commando class
	- Input Manager?

- Use layer for raycast and overlapsphere to improve efficiency

- Enemy mesh should contain the collider and a script that links to the parent object containing the script

- Check hardcoded key presses and convert to using input manager

- Clean up weapon pickup code

- Add color change to pickups which is the closest one

- Shootarget prefab: mesh should be child of meshless object containing the script

- Try Function overloading to return different data types

- Camera movement following mouse gets offset the more the player move
	- Disabled for now, fix later

- Pass in the player gameObject for the pickupEffect function, the function can then access the component needed for the effect

- PoolManager
	- Make a spawn function that returns an array on Gameobjects (less iterations) // DONE

	- There is a bug that occurs rarely
	- Hacked in a fix for now
	- Still have to find out what causes it
	- Might happen only when clonelimit is on

- Bullet update
	- Optimize
		- Reduce amount of Vector3.Distance called

- Homing Bullet
	- Try to implement exponential curve for homing speed //DONE
	- Implement angle at which bullet will detect target to home to //DONE
	- UpdateRate useless as Time.deltatime is around 0.018 on Studio XPS

=================================================================================================================================================


- Implement Character Controller // DONE
	- Check how Character Controller works
		- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEqBzTcuEVw

- Bullets	//DONE
	- Save previous and current bullet position
	- Raycast from previous to current
	- From list of hits, get the one closest to the previous position
	- Apply damage and destroy bullet

- Fix RangedWeaponClass + all base and subclass //DONE


- Make a pool manager for bullets //DONE

- Ask Glenn about his pool manager // DONE
	- Pool Manager example: http://poolmanager.path-o-logical.com/
	- Try to implement a poolmanager that works for any kind of objects

- Cleanup melee weapon code //DONE
	- Messy and inefficient
	- Consider switching to sphereoverlap and use angle to check if enemies are in front

- Get Animation to work on melee weapon //DONE

- Find a way to access animation frame so that damage can be applied at a specific animation frame //SCRAPPED
	- A timer can be used using the animationLength variable


//Ideas

- Check Point
	- Polygon with rigibody and clamped position x,y,z (Yay spiny!)

- Bullet behaviors
	- Homing Bullets
	- Boomerang Bullets

- Use trail renderer for melee weapon

- Make an AttackBase Class and store attacks logics in Attack gameobjects.
	- Weapons have slots for attacks (Primary,Secondary)
	- When player calls weapons for primary/secondary, weapon calls the attack logic from the equipped attack

- AlienSwarm example
	- Smoke after bullets
	- Exact cursor position for targeting (e.g: Grenades)
		- Store in lookat class
	- Check how melee weapon (chainsaw) work

- Check AI pathfinder script for smooth movement,rotation

- Bullet that accelerates over time
	- http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/76470-Moving-a-RigidBody-at-a-constant-speed

- Ask for stylized art style






- Melee Weapon //SCRAPPED
	- Use trail renderer for better effect
	- Use impact animation on ground to give better feedback of area damaged
	- Use different values for raycast area depending on swing animation

- Janitor Mop //SCRAPPED
	- Primary: Sweeping move damages in a cone
	- Secondary: Piercing damages enemies in a line
		- last enemy takes less damage?

// Weapon Swap System

Make it so that it limits players to carry ONLY a primary and secondary weapon + primary weapon cannot be dropped

v/s

Make it so that players can carry any number of guns <- More panache as a programmer //I CHOSE YOU!
